# shiny_likelihoods

This app was originally created by Fabian Dablander for this blog post: http://alexanderetz.com/2015/04/15/understanding-bayes-a-look-at-the-likelihood/

All credit to Fabian for that awesome app!

Currently I am working on adding prior and posterior distributions, as well as calculating bayesfactors and credible intervals.

Feel free to share but please let me know if you do, since it is not finished yet. :)
